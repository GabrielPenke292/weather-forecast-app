# Weather Forecast App

## Description
This Weather Forecast App is a simple yet powerful tool that provides real-time weather information. Built with React, it allows users to search for cities by typing their names in an input field. As the user types, the app dynamically fetches a list of matching cities using the AccuWeather API. Upon selecting a city, it then retrieves detailed weather forecasts through the OpenWeatherMap API, displaying the data in an intuitive card format.

## Features
- **Dynamic City Search**: Search for cities in real-time as you type.
- **Weather Information**: Displays the name of the city, country initials, current temperature in Celsius, a brief description of the weather, and an icon representing the current climate.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile use.
